# Warehouse Wreckage

**Game Engine:** Unreal Engine 5  
**Visual Scripting:** Blueprint

#### Game Overview

**Concept:**  
Warehouse Wreckage is an exciting physics-based game that challenges players to unleash maximum destruction by launching projectiles at various objects within a meticulously crafted warehouse environment.

**Objective:**  
The primary objective of Warehouse Wreckage is to strategically utilize a limited number of projectiles to cause extensive damage to the objects scattered throughout the warehouse. Players must aim carefully, considering the physics of each projectile's trajectory and the impact it will have on the environment.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**  
- **Projectile Launching:** Players control the firing and trajectory of projectiles aimed at crates, barrels, and structures within the warehouse.
- **Physics Simulation:** Unreal Engine 5's advanced physics engine accurately models the dynamics of object interactions, ensuring realistic and visually compelling destruction effects.
- **Limited Resources:** With a finite number of projectiles at their disposal, players must optimize their shots to maximize destruction. Upon exhausting projectiles, players can reload the scene to refine their strategies and achieve higher scores.
- **Interactive Environment:** The warehouse environment features destructible elements and interactive objects, providing dynamic gameplay experiences with each playthrough.
